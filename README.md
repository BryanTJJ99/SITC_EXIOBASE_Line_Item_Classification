# SITC_EXIOBASE_Line_Item_Classification
BERT-based multi-label text classifier for SITC &amp; EXIOBASE datasets, streamlining item description labeling

This project centers on the development of an automatic multi-label text classification system using BERT transformers. The system is designed to predict labels for item descriptions from a vast dataset, addressing operational challenges related to line-item classification for individual products within the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) and the global, comprehensive Multi-Regional Environmentally Extended Supply-Use Table (MR-SUT) and Input-Output Table (MR-IOT) known as EXIOBASE.

This system not only includes the model itself but also a user-friendly front-end interface built with React.js. Additionally, a responsive backend powered by Flask was created to enable seamless interactions with the trained model.
